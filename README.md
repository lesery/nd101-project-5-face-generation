# nd101-project-5-face-generation
The last project on Deel Learning Foundation Nanodegree course. In this project, generative adversarial networks (GAN) are used to generate new images of faces.

You'll be using two datasets in this project:
MNIST
CelebA
Since the celebA dataset is complex and you're doing GANs in a project for the first time, we want you to test your neural network on MNIST before CelebA. Running the GANs on MNIST will allow you to see how well your model trains sooner.
